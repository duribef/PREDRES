# PREDRES
Prediction of Anthropogenic Marine Debris (AMD) with very high spatial resolution. 

AMD is one of the most important pollutants in over oceans and millions of tons have been described in several oceans generating a critical environmental problem. 

This project looks forward the combination of hyperspectral laboratory characterization of AMD in order to be used for digital supervised classification based on high spatial remote sensing imagery. Several samples collected in the Chilo√© shore island were processed in a laboratory in order to analyze the spectral signature in addition to physical characteristics.
